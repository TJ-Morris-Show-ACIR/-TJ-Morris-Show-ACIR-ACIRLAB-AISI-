## 150 Capstone Initiative

Our 150 Capstone initiative brings together projects that span customer success, infrastructure automation, and AI-assisted
service delivery. Each capstone is designed to be:

1. **Mission Critical** — Solves a clearly defined operational gap.
2. **Automation Friendly** — Builds reusable components compatible with the Jet Services orchestration fabric.
3. **Data Guided** — Captures telemetry for ongoing optimization and learning.

Explore the [Capstone Tracker](guides/capstone-tracker) for status dashboards, milestone reviews, and deployment artifacts.
